# NLP Model Translation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based translation system for converting text between English and Thai. It supports both translation directionsâ€”English to Thai and Thai to English. The model is optimized for translating basic sentences, though it faces challenges with more intricate phrases due to training limitations.

## Topics

**ENG-THA/THA-ENG Machine Translation**

**Objective:** Develop a machine translation system for [English to Thai] & [Thai to English]
translation.

**Dataset:** Sentence pairs in English and Thai languages from AI Research Thailand.

**Description:** You will build a transformer model (e.g., Transformer, BART) to translate sentences between English and Thai languages. The model should accurately translate text from one language to another while preserving meaning and context.

## Usage Instructions

**- Input:** Provide a sentence in either English or Thai.

**- Select Translation Direction:** Choose [1] for English to Thai or [2] for Thai to English.

**- Output:** The model returns the translated text based on your selection. 

## Model Training Details

**- Training Sessions:** Conducted in four iterations, using checkpoints to incrementally improve the model without starting from scratch.

**- Simplified Configuration:** Due to resource limitations, training was done with basic settings to showcase the translation capabilities while minimizing time and memory requirements.

## Features

**- Dual Translation Options:**
    - [1] English to Thai (EN-TH)
    - [2] Thai to English (TH-EN)
    
**- Basic Sentence Handling:** Translates straightforward sentences with relative ease.

**- Custom Deep Learning Model:** Specifically designed for the English-Thai language pair, trained on a custom dataset.
