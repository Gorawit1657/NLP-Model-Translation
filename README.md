# NLP Model Translation

## Project Overview

In this project aims to tackle real-world NLP challenges using transformer-based models. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in building and deploying NLP systems.

## Topics

**ENG-THA/THA-ENG Machine Translation**

**Objective:** Develop a machine translation system for [English to Thai] & [Thai to English]
translation.

**Dataset:** Sentence pairs in English and Thai languages from AI Research Thailand.

**Description:** You will build a transformer model (e.g., Transformer, BART) to translate sentences between English and Thai languages. The model should accurately translate text from one language to another while preserving meaning and context.

## Key Achievements

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Conducted thorough exploratory analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Developed and selected important features that improved model accuracy.
- **Model Building**: Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) and compared their performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Improved model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search and cross-validation.
- **Result Interpretation**: Provided insights and actionable recommendations based on model predictions.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Includes detailed visualizations of data distributions, relationships, and trends.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates and compares multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing algorithm.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses techniques like grid search and random search to find the optimal parameters for each model.
- **Result Reporting**: Clearly presents model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The project showcases how to approach a data science problem from end to end, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and optimization. The results highlight the predictive power of the models and provide meaningful insights based on the predictions.
